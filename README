Insects and Plants Game

By Jeremy Su, Ian Mao, and Max Tung

Technologies used: Python (add game libraries if used)


Purpose: Create a game with Python where Insects are used to eat Plants

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//*******************      DESIGN      ****************************//
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

A user will place insects on a game board in a strategic way that will
let the insects eat all the plants in the allotted time.

///////////////////// What is an insect? ///////////////////////////

An insect can be one of a Bee, an Ant, or a Praying Mantis.

Bee: a Bee can eat flowers only. It moves at a speed of 1 in a vertical
pattern

Ant: an Ant can eat leaves. It moves at a speed of 2 in a horizontal pattern

Praying Mantis: a Praying mantis can eat any type of plant and moves at a
speed of 4 in a diagonal pattern


////////////////////// What is a Plant? /////////////////////////////

A plant is either a flower or a leaf. It starts in a specific place on the
board. Plants do not move.

Flower: Bees and Praying Mantises eat flowers

Leaf: Ants and Praying Mantises eat leaves

A user wins if all plants are eaten.

//************************ Implementation *****************************//
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

There will be three main classes: Game class, Board class, and Insect class

Game class: Holds all the necessary concurrency locks, as well as both the
Board class and all Insect class instances

Board class: Controls the state of the board and draws the state at every
game loop

Insect class: contains information about the type of insect and controls
its movement. It also tells the board where to place itself. Each insect 
instance will run its code in a separate thread.
